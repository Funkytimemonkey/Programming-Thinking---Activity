You want to go through it all, and decide what to do with each piece of mail.Write the pseudo code for your process of going through the mail
What are the types of mail you might get?  Junk mail, letters from friends, tax documents, bills.

What steps do you take to determine what type of mail it is?  What do you do with all the paper?  Throw it away, recycle it, shred it, put it in a filingcabinet?
